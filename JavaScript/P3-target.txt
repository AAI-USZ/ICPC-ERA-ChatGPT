The missing part in the code is: `storage.set(paramObject, opt_callback);`. This line of code is using the `set` method from the `chrome.storage` API to set the `value` of the `key` in the specified `storageId` storage area. The method takes in two parameters: the first is an object containing the `storageId`, `key`, and `value` and the second is an optional callback function `opt_callback`.
The missing part in the code is: `"active"`. The line of code is using the `removeClass` method from the jQuery library to remove the class `"active"` from the element selected by `$curr`. The method takes in a single string parameter representing the class name to be removed.
The missing part in the code is: `key`. The line of code is checking the value of the `operator` variable, and if it's not equal to `'*'`, it returns the `key` value. This part of the code is likely creating a regular expression pattern used to match strings. The `keys` array is also being populated with the `key` value.
The missing part in the code could be a variety of things, depending on the context and purpose of the code. Without additional information, it's difficult to determine what the missing part should be. Could you provide more context or information about the code's purpose?

The missing part in the code is: `.getId`. The line of code is using the `assert.equal` method from the `assert` library to test if the value returned by the `getId` method of the `emp` object is equal to the expected value. The `assert.instanceOf` method is being used to test if the `emp` object is an instance of the `Employee` class.

The missing part in the code is: `.then(renderRelatedContent)`. The line of code is using the `then` method from a Promise object to chain a render function `renderRelatedContent` to the result of calling `getRelatedContent()`. The `then` method takes a callback function as an argument and is executed when the Promise is resolved successfully. The `getRelatedContent` function likely returns a Promise that resolves with some data, which can be passed as an argument to the `renderRelatedContent` function to render the content on the page.
The missing part in the code is: `, res`. The line of code is using the `Object.append` method to merge the properties of the `res` object with the `this` object. The `callback` function is then being called to perform some action. The method is not part of the native JavaScript API and may be a custom method or from a library.
The missing part in the code is: `, index = Array.prototype.indexOf.call(styleSheet.cssRules, rule);`. The line of code is using the `Array.prototype.indexOf` method to find the index of the `rule` object within the `cssRules` property of the `styleSheet` object. The method is being called using the `call` method to set the `this` value to `styleSheet.cssRules`. The index of the `rule` object within the `cssRules` property is then stored in the `index` variable.
